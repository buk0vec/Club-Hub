# Club-Hub
Mobile app based in React Native for Projects in CS 2020.
The goal of the app is for high schoolers to be able to find, learn about, and communicate with clubs easily.
There should be four people contributing to this repository but I'm the only one. At least I can publish straight to master without crapping myself
## Install
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Build and run with `react-native run-android`
4. If bad things happen, `cd android` and `gradlew clean`
5. If more bad things happen, just come to Nick and he will attempt to bless you.
